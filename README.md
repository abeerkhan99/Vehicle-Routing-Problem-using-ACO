# About This
This is part of the second assignment of the CS-451 Computational Intelligence Spring 2022 course that was offered at Habib University. The primary objective of this assignment was to find an optimal solution (the best smallest distance) for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm. The algorithm was implemented using a Python class. Further information related to this can be found in the documentation provided in the Documentation folder of this repository.

<h3>How to Run?</h3>

  - Download vrp-aco.py and the dataset provided in the repository into a folder, and run the file. The output would be in the format: "Best distance so far: Value". 

  - You can change the parameters, and observe how the algorithm performs using a combination of different parameters, if you wish to do so. You can also attempt to run this using a different dataset instance, which can be found in the dataset folder of this repository.
